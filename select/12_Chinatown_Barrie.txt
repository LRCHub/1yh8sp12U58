You give some and you take a little
It works out sometimes better than others
Oh never got my chance to say it
Oh but I can be so cruel

Oh the light in Chinatown tonight
Those are weaker days
When I talk to you, when I say your name
I can't tell if I fell back asleep
Those were weaker days, when I talked to you

Sitting on a sink in the boys room
Ducking their head to get their hair cut
Nothing on the neck, nothing on the side
It comes off so easy

Oh the light in Chinatown tonight
Those were weaker days
When I talked to you, when I say your name
I can't tell if I fell back asleep
Those were weaker days, when I talked to you
