Yin yang
A feeling抯 evolving through me
Sweet and sour
Is the taste you bring

When I said goodbye, you loved me
When I turned to you, you turned away
When I was so gung-ho
He said 憀et me go? br>
He begged me to stay, stay, stay
If I try to find out what抯 on your mind
I抣l find out in Chinatown

Chorus:
Chinatown
I don抰 know how to read you
Upside down
The signs will all mislead you
Like this town
You抮e such a mystery to me
Chinatown
I don抰 know how to read you
Upside down
The signs will all mislead you

I抣l track you down
And you抣l go crazy for me
So much smoke I can抰 get through to you
Eyes that I can抰 see

They stare me down
Here I抦 chasin? you
Some crazy Fu Manchu
And it feels so wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

When I try to find out what抯 on your mind
I抣l find out in Chinatown

Chorus
