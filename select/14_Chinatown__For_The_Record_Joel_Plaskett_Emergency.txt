Where did you go after the show?
I went looking for you out in the snow
After so many years it's ending in tears
Where will you be when the smoke all clears

I don't know why I came here in the first place
To find you, to find myself, to tell the truth or to save face
I've got a picture of you, I carry around
But china's not the same as Chinatown
